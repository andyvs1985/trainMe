		<p> This is paragraph text. Paragraphs are defined with the this tag. Think of a paragraph as a block of text. You can use the align attribute with a paragraph tag as well. Important: You must indicate paragraphs with this elements. A browser ignores any indentations or blank lines in the source text. Without this elements, the document becomes
        one large paragraph. HTML automatically adds an extra blank line before and after a paragraph.</p>
